# 📘 Session 4: HTML Tags to Leave Behind

### 🧨 Understanding Deprecated Code and Embracing Modern Practices

---

## 🎯 **Session Overview**

As web technologies evolve, some HTML tags have become **deprecated**—meaning they’re no longer supported in current standards. These tags may still work in some browsers, but they’re considered **outdated**, **inaccessible**, and **bad practice** for modern web development.

In this session, you’ll learn:

* What deprecated tags are and why they’ve been phased out
* How to spot outdated HTML in legacy websites
* How to replace deprecated tags with **semantic HTML** and **CSS**

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts

* A **deprecated** tag is one that’s been removed from modern HTML specs.
* Modern websites separate **structure (HTML)** from **style (CSS)**.
* Deprecated tags often break accessibility and do not respond well on mobile devices.
* Using semantic HTML improves **readability**, **maintainability**, and **accessibility**.

---

## 💡 Why Are Tags Deprecated?

### 🧩 *Example: What’s Wrong With This Code?*

```html
<font color="blue">Welcome to My Website</font>
```

### ✅ *Answer:*

This mixes **content with styling**. `<font>` is a **deprecated** tag used to change text color and font directly in HTML. Modern best practices move these styles to CSS to separate content from design.

```html
<p class="welcome-text">Welcome to My Website</p>
```

```css
.welcome-text {
  color: blue;
}
```

---

## 🔁 From Old to Modern: Common Replacements

| ❌ Deprecated Tag | 🚫 Problem                        | ✅ Use Instead                               |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `<center>`       | Purely visual, no meaning         | `text-align: center` in CSS                 |
| `<font>`         | Messy inline styling              | CSS `color`, `font-family`, etc.            |
| `<frameset>`     | Doesn’t work on mobile, breaks UX | `<iframe>` or responsive layouts            |
| `<marquee>`      | Distracting, unreadable           | CSS animations or JavaScript                |
| `<tt>`           | Old teletype styling              | `<code>` or `font-family: monospace` in CSS |

---

## 🔍 *Example: Why Did `<font>` Disappear but `<strong>` Didn’t?*

### ✅ *Explanation:*

* `<font>` controls **appearance only** — it has no semantic meaning.
* `<strong>` conveys **meaning and emphasis**, which can be understood by screen readers.
* Semantic tags stay; visual-only tags go.

---

## 💬 *Example: How Do Deprecated Tags Affect Accessibility?*

### ✅ *Explanation:*

Assistive technologies (like screen readers) depend on **semantic tags** to interpret and present content. Using `<font>` or `<center>` offers no meaning to those users, while `<strong>`, `<section>`, or `<header>` help users understand content structure.

---

## 💀 Code Autopsy: Before and After

### ❌ Old Way (Deprecated)

```html
<center>
  <font color="green" size="5">Hello!</font>
</center>
```

### ✅ New Way (Modern)

```html
<h1 class="greeting">Hello!</h1>
```

```css
.greeting {
  color: green;
  font-size: 2rem;
  text-align: center;
}
```

---

## 🧪 Activities (with Built-In Explanations)

### 🔧 Activity 1: Fix the Zombie Code 🧟‍♂️

> ✏️ *Task:*
> You're working on an old website. You find the following code:

```html
<marquee>Latest News: Site Under Construction</marquee>
```

🔍 *Question:* Why is this a problem, and how would you modernize it?

### ✅ *Answer & Solution:*

* `<marquee>` creates a scrolling effect but has **zero accessibility**, causes distraction, and is **deprecated**.
* Replace it with a CSS animation.

```html
<p class="news-banner">Latest News: Site Under Construction</p>
```

```css
.news-banner {
  animation: scroll-left 8s linear infinite;
  white-space: nowrap;
  display: inline-block;
}

@keyframes scroll-left {
  from { transform: translateX(100%); }
  to   { transform: translateX(-100%); }
}
```

---

### 👓 Activity 2: Accessibility Test

> ✏️ *Task:*
> You're reviewing two similar HTML snippets:

```html
<b>Breaking News</b>
```

vs.

```html
<strong>Breaking News</strong>
```

🔍 *Question:* Which one should you use and why?

### ✅ *Answer:*

Use `<strong>`. While both tags display bold text:

* `<b>` is **presentational only**
* `<strong>` is **semantic**, telling screen readers the text is important

---

### 🧰 Tool Tip:

Use the [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to test for deprecated tags and invalid HTML.

---

## 🌐 Real-World Consequences

### ⚠️ SEO Problems

* Deprecated tags like `<marquee>` may be **ignored by search engines**
* Poor structure or mobile compatibility can **lower page rankings**

### 🧏 Accessibility Risks

* Tags like `<blink>`, `<marquee>`, and `<frameset>`:

  * Create unusable layouts for screen readers
  * May violate **WCAG** accessibility guidelines
  * Can even cause health issues (e.g., flashing content)

# 📘 Session 5: Standard Compliance and Browser Consistency

### 🤖 Why HTML Validation Matters and How Browsers React to Errors

---

## 🎯 **Session Overview**

Have you ever noticed that your webpage looks perfect in one browser... but completely broken in another? That’s often due to **invalid HTML** or missing a crucial line like `<!DOCTYPE html>`. This session will show you **why standards compliance matters**, how different browsers interpret bad code, and what you can do to ensure consistent behavior.

You’ll learn:

* The difference between **standards mode** and **quirks mode**
* Why a simple mistake like a missing tag can lead to **big bugs**
* Tools that help you write clean, professional HTML

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts

* `<!DOCTYPE html>` tells browsers to use **standards mode**
* **Invalid HTML** (like missing end tags) triggers **quirky behavior**
* Browsers try to "fix" bad HTML — but each one does it differently
* Validation helps you write code that’s **predictable**, **maintainable**, and **accessible**

---

## 🔎 What Is Standards Mode vs. Quirks Mode?

### 💬 *Student Question:*

**What happens if I forget to include `<!DOCTYPE html>` at the top of my HTML file?**

### ✅ *Explanation:*

Without it, your browser falls into **quirks mode** — a backward-compatibility setting that mimics old browser bugs (especially from Internet Explorer). In quirks mode:

* Padding and borders behave **incorrectly**
* CSS layouts may **break**
* Your site may render differently in **each browser**

---

### 📌 Real Example: The Box Model Problem

Here’s a div styled with CSS:

```css
div {
  width: 100px;
  padding: 20px;
  border: 2px solid black;
}
```

#### ✅ With `<!DOCTYPE html>` (Standards Mode):

The total width = 100 (content) + 20+20 (padding) + 2+2 (border) = **144px**

#### ❌ Without DOCTYPE (Quirks Mode):

The browser tries to fit **everything** into the 100px width! The padding and border squeeze the content.

---

## 🧪 Try It Yourself: DOCTYPE Detective 🔍

> ✏️ *Activity:* Create two HTML files. In both, include this in the body:

```html
<div>This box should look the same</div>
```

Add this CSS:

```css
div {
  width: 200px;
  padding: 50px;
  background: lightgray;
}
```

* In File A, include `<!DOCTYPE html>` at the top
* In File B, leave it out

✅ *What to Observe:*

* The box will look **normal** in File A
* The box will appear **shrunk or broken** in File B

---

## 💣 Common HTML Errors (and What They Break)

Even small mistakes in HTML can lead to huge headaches.

| ❌ Error                             | 🤖 What the Browser Does                    | 🧨 Risk                         |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Missing `</li>`                     | Browser guesses where to close              | Messed-up lists                 |
| Unquoted attribute: `alt=cat photo` | Might be accepted... unless there’s a space | Image fails to load             |
| Duplicate IDs                       | JS/CSS only affects the first match         | Buttons or scripts stop working |
| Bad nesting: `<p><div>`             | Breaks document structure                   | Screen readers get confused     |

---

## 🔍 *Student Question:*

**What does it mean when the browser "fixes" my HTML?**

### ✅ *Answer:*

Browsers try to repair broken HTML to display something usable. But each browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) **guesses differently** — leading to **inconsistent layouts** and weird bugs.

Example:

```html
<p><strong>Hello<span>World</p></strong></span>
```

This is invalid — tags aren’t properly closed or nested.

* Chrome might close the `<p>` early
* Firefox might treat `<span>` as outside `<strong>`
* Edge may interpret it totally differently

That’s why **validation matters**.

---

## 🛠 Hands-On: Cross-Browser Behavior

> ✏️ *Activity:* Paste this broken code into a new HTML file:

```html
<p><strong>Hello<span>World</p></strong></span>
```

1. Open the file in Chrome, Firefox, and Edge
2. Right-click → **Inspect Element**
3. Look at how each browser fixes the structure in the Elements tab
4. Try fixing the nesting yourself to see how it should look:

```html
<p><strong>Hello <span>World</span></strong></p>
```

✅ *Takeaway:* Invalid HTML might seem "fine" at first... but can behave unpredictably across platforms.

---

## 💼 Real-World Relevance

### 🛠️ **Technical Debt and Maintenance Costs**

Every unclosed tag or syntax shortcut might save you 2 seconds today...
But cost you **2 hours** when your layout suddenly breaks in Safari.

A 2023 developer report showed:

> Dev teams spend **19% of their time** debugging layout bugs caused by inconsistent HTML structure.

---

### ♿ Accessibility Risks

Screen readers and assistive tech depend on **proper structure**.

Poorly written HTML can:

* Skip over content entirely
* Misread table rows or lists
* Confuse headings and navigation

```html
<p><div>This is not okay</div></p>  <!-- Invalid -->
```

✅ Correct structure:

```html
<p>This is okay.</p>
<div>This is okay too.</div>
```

---

## 🧠 Final Check: What You Should Know Now

> Ask yourself (or discuss with a peer):

1. What does `<!DOCTYPE html>` do?
2. What’s the difference between **standards mode** and **quirks mode**?
3. Why is it risky to rely on browsers "fixing" your mistakes?
4. How do validation tools help professional developers?

# 🔹 **Session 6: Core Page Tags — Building Meaningful Structure**

## 🎯 **Session Overview**

Every webpage has a backbone — a structure made of essential HTML tags. These tags are the first things browsers, search engines, and screen readers look at. If they’re missing or incorrect, your page might still work… but it won’t work **well**.

In this session, you’ll learn:

* What the **core tags** of every HTML document are
* How they affect **SEO**, **accessibility**, and **social sharing**
* What information goes into the `<head>` vs. the `<body>`
* How to write a **fully valid**, standards-compliant HTML template from scratch

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts

| Concept           | What It Means                                               |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **DOCTYPE**       | Tells the browser to use modern HTML rules (standards mode) |
| **`<html>`**      | The root of every HTML document                             |
| **`<head>`**      | Invisible information: metadata, styles, page title         |
| **`<body>`**      | Everything visible to the user                              |
| **`<meta>` tags** | Provide search engines and devices with info about the page |
| **`<title>`**     | Appears in browser tabs and search engine results           |

---

## 🔍 *Student Question:*

**“Do I really need all those tags just to show a heading?”**

### ✅ *Answer:*

Technically, browsers will display something even with broken or incomplete HTML. But skipping required tags:

* Hurts **SEO** (your page might not be indexed correctly)
* Confuses **screen readers** (accessibility suffers)
* Can cause **quirks mode** to activate (from Session 5)
* Makes your site **harder to maintain**

Just like every house needs a foundation—even if it’s a small house—every HTML page needs its core structure.

---

## 🧩 **HTML Core Tag Reference**

| Tag                      | Required?    | Why It’s Important                                     |
| ------------------------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `<!DOCTYPE html>`        | ✅            | Enables modern browser behavior (standards mode)       |
| `<html lang="en">`       | ✅            | Helps screen readers know how to pronounce content     |
| `<head>`                 | ✅            | Where metadata, SEO info, styles, and links live       |
| `<meta charset="UTF-8">` | ✅            | Supports all characters (including emojis, accents)    |
| `<meta name="viewport">` | ✅ for mobile | Makes your site responsive on phones and tablets       |
| `<title>`                | ✅            | Appears in browser tabs and Google results             |
| `<body>`                 | ✅            | Holds all visible content like text, links, and images |

---

## 💻 Example: Valid HTML Skeleton

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Welcome to My Website</title>
  <meta name="description" content="This is a simple webpage built with semantic HTML.">
  <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico">
</head>
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>Welcome to My Site</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p>This is where the content goes.</p>
  </main>
</body>
</html>
```

---

## 🧠 *Student Question:*

**“What’s the difference between `<head>` and `<body>`?”**

### ✅ *Answer:*

Think of `<head>` as **the behind-the-scenes setup**:
It tells browsers how to handle the page (what encoding to use, what styles to load, what to show in Google results).

The `<body>` is **everything users see**: text, images, links, navigation, etc.

## 📈 How Tags Affect SEO and Sharing

| Tag                         | Helps With                         | Example                                             |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `<title>`                   | SEO ranking + tab label            | `<title>My Portfolio Site</title>`                  |
| `<meta name="description">` | Search result snippet              | “Freelance developer portfolio and blog”            |
| `og:` tags                  | Facebook, LinkedIn, Slack previews | `<meta property="og:image" content="headshot.jpg">` |

🧪 *Test it:* Use [https://metatags.io/](https://metatags.io/) to preview what your site would look like when shared!

---

## 🛠️ **Hands-On Activities**

### **Activity 1: Rebuild the Skeleton**

> Goal: Practice writing a valid HTML document from memory

1. Create a new `.html` file
2. Without looking up examples, write all required tags
3. Add a `<title>`, `<meta charset>`, and `<meta name="viewport">`
4. Use the [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to check for errors
5. Compare with a peer — what did you miss or do differently?

---
### ✅ **Example 1: Rebuilding the HTML Skeleton from Memory**

Let’s walk through what a you might come up with after learning the essential page structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Sample Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

**Reflection:**
At first glance, this seems fine—it loads in a browser. But let’s break it down:

| ✅ Correct                     | ⚠️ Missing or Incomplete                       |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `<!DOCTYPE html>` is there     | No `lang="en"` attribute on `<html>`           |
| `<head>` and `<body>` included | Missing `<meta charset>` and `<meta viewport>` |
| Title is present               | No SEO description or favicon                  |

After validating the page using [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/), several **warnings** would appear:

* Character encoding is not specified → may lead to text display issues
* No viewport settings → won’t render well on phones
* Missing language declaration → screen readers may default to the wrong pronunciation rules

**Lesson:**
Even if your page "works," browsers and search engines rely on behind-the-scenes code for performance and accessibility. Small omissions can snowball into real problems.

---

### **Activity 2: The Meta Tag Lab**

> Goal: See how metadata affects Google and social results

1. Make two HTML files:

   * Version A: No `<meta>` tags
   * Version B: Includes `<meta name="description">` and `og:` tags
2. Use [Google's Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results) or MetaTags.io
3. Observe how differently each version is displayed

✅ *Reflection:* Which version would YOU be more likely to click?

---

Two versions of the same page were tested using [MetaTags.io](https://metatags.io/) and Google's Rich Results Tool.

#### Version A – *No Metadata*

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Portfolio</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hi, I’m Alex!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

#### Version B – *With Metadata*

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Alex's Portfolio</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Creative frontend developer specializing in responsive design and web animation.">
  <meta property="og:image" content="https://example.com/profile.jpg">
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hi, I’m Alex!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

**Result Comparison (in Meta Preview Tool):**

| Feature               | Version A        | Version B                            |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Search preview text   | None or random   | “Creative frontend developer...”     |
| Tab/Link preview      | Basic title only | Title + profile image                |
| Mobile responsiveness | Poor             | Fully responsive due to viewport tag |

**Lesson:**
Adding just a few lines of `<meta>` code makes your page:

* **More searchable**
* **Better-looking when shared**
* **Easier to use on mobile**

And it takes less than 2 minutes to do.
