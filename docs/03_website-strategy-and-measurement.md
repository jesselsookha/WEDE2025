# Website Strategy and Measurement

By now, you understand **why websites matter** and **what makes them effective**. In this final part of the unit, we connect websites to **bigger goals** ‚Äî how they serve organizations, how we measure their success, and how we make decisions based on real user behaviour.

Even a beautiful website isn't "successful" unless it supports the organization‚Äôs objectives ‚Äî whether that's generating revenue, informing users, raising donations, or building trust.

## 1. Aligning Websites with Organizational Goals

Different organizations have different goals ‚Äî and their websites should reflect that.

### 1.1 Business vs. Non-Profit Goals

| Type of Organization | Website Goal Examples                                   |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **E-commerce**       | Drive sales, build trust, reduce cart abandonment       |
| **Service Business** | Generate leads, bookings, or enquiries                  |
| **Non-Profit**       | Increase donations, recruit volunteers, raise awareness |
| **Educational**      | Share knowledge, register students, provide resources   |

üß† *Key Question*: What does the website need to accomplish for the organization to succeed?

---

### 1.2 Design That Serves Strategy

Different goals lead to different design choices:

- A **restaurant** might need:
  - Menu pages
  - Location map
  - Online booking or ordering

- A **non-profit** might focus on:
  - Emotional storytelling
  - Clear "Donate Now" buttons
  - Transparency (financial reports, testimonials)

üéØ *Design is not decoration ‚Äî it‚Äôs direction.* Every element on a site should support its purpose.

---

## 2. Measuring Website Success

How do we know if a website is actually working?

We use **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** ‚Äî measurable values that tell us if we‚Äôre achieving our goals.

### 2.1 Examples of Common KPIs

| KPI                        | What It Tells You                                      |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **New Visitors**           | Is your reach growing?                                 |
| **Bounce Rate**            | Are visitors leaving too quickly?                      |
| **Time on Page**           | Are users engaged with the content?                   |
| **Form Submissions**       | Are people taking action (e.g., signing up)?          |
| **Conversion Rate**        | Are visits turning into results (sales, signups)?      |
| **Click-Through Rate (CTR)** | Are CTAs and links getting engagement?              |

ü©∫ *Think of KPIs like a fitness tracker for your website ‚Äî they show progress, problems, and opportunities.*

---

### 2.2 SMART KPIs

Good KPIs follow the **SMART** principle:

- **Specific**: Clear and focused
- **Measurable**: You can track it with data
- **Achievable**: Realistic within available resources
- **Relevant**: Tied to your goals
- **Time-bound**: Has a deadline or regular review

üéØ *Example*: ‚ÄúIncrease newsletter signups by 20% within 3 months‚Äù is a SMART KPI.

---

## 3. The HITS Framework

A helpful way to plan and review website effectiveness is the **HITS** framework:

> **HITS** = *How Idiots Track Success* ‚Äî a memorable way to break down the process.

| Element                      | Description                                                       |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **H** (Human/Audience)       | Who is the website for? What are their needs and habits?          |
| **I** (Intent/Organization)  | What does the organization need to achieve through the site?      |
| **T** (Tools/Content)        | What features, content, and functions will help?                  |
| **S** (Success Indicators)   | How will we measure if the site is doing its job?                 |

üìå *HITS helps align strategy with structure ‚Äî always start with users and purpose before jumping into design.*

---

## 4. Calculating Return on Investment (ROI)

### 4.1 What Is ROI?

**ROI = (Return ‚Äì Cost) / Cost**

This tells you whether the time and money spent on a website is worth it.

üìà *A higher ROI means the website is delivering value.*

---

### 4.2 ROI Isn‚Äôt Always About Money

Not every website has financial goals ‚Äî especially blogs, portfolios, or non-profit sites.

Other types of return might include:

- Increased visibility
- Improved user engagement
- More sign-ups or downloads
- Higher volunteer numbers
- Better brand reputation

üß† *Success can be measured in trust, not just cash.*

---

### 4.3 Practical Example

| Website Type          | Potential Investment | Returns Measured By                        |
|------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **E-commerce**         | R30,000 setup + R2,000/month | Sales, average order value, cart abandonment rate |
| **Tutorial Blog**      | R1,000 setup + Time | Traffic growth, time on page, backlinks     |
| **Non-profit**         | R15,000 setup | Donations, volunteer sign-ups, reach        |
| **Bed & Breakfast**    | R8,000 setup | Booking requests, map clicks, contact form use |

## 5. Fundamentals Done Right

Before fancy features, a successful website needs solid foundations.

### 5.1 Checklist of Essentials

- ‚úÖ Clear and consistent navigation
- ‚úÖ Fast loading pages
- ‚úÖ Working internal and external links
- ‚úÖ Mobile-friendly design
- ‚úÖ Up-to-date and accurate content
- ‚úÖ Accessible layout (contrast, alt text, readable fonts)
- ‚úÖ Visible and usable contact info
  - Name, phone number, email
  - Google Maps embed (if location matters)

üß± *Build the house before decorating it.*

## 6. The Tech Behind It All (Quick Intro)

Every website is built using 3 core technologies:

| Technology | Role                                                   |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **HTML**   | Structure ‚Äî headings, paragraphs, images, links        |
| **CSS**    | Design ‚Äî colours, layouts, fonts                        |
| **JavaScript** | Behaviour ‚Äî animations, form validation, interactivity |

üß† *Think of it like this*:
- HTML = bricks and walls
- CSS = paint and decoration
- JavaScript = electricity and moving parts

We‚Äôll dive into these in the practical sessions ‚Äî but it helps to understand how they come together.

## 7. Assets & Legal Considerations

### 7.1 Using Assets (Images, Text, Icons)

- Always use **licensed** or **free-to-use** resources.
- Credit creators when required.
- Don‚Äôt copy-paste large blocks of text from other websites.

üñºÔ∏è *Good sources for free assets*:
- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com)
- [Pexels](https://pexels.com)
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com)
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com)

---

### 7.2 Optimizing Assets

Large images = slow sites.

Use tools to reduce file size without losing quality:

- [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com)
- [Adobe Express](https://express.adobe.com)
- [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app)

üì∑ *Tip*: Resize images for their real use ‚Äî don‚Äôt upload 5000px-wide images for a 300px space.
