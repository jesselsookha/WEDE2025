# 🌐 WEDE5020 - Introduction to Web Development 

Welcome to the official course repository for **Introduction to Web Development**. This subject introduces the core building blocks of the modern web, combining hands-on coding with conceptual understanding of how websites are planned, built, and deployed.

Over the semester, we will cover:

- ✅ **HTML** – the structure of web pages  
- ✅ **CSS** – styling and layout  
- ✅ **Responsive Web Design** – making websites work across devices  
- ✅ **JavaScript** – adding interactivity  
- ✅ **Publishing & Analytics** – launching sites and measuring performance  

This repository will evolve alongside your learning journey. Use it actively to refer to notes, access code examples, track project requirements, and collaborate with your group.

## 📁 Folder Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
/
├── docs/                # Course notes and learning unit guides
│   ├── 01-intro         # Learning Unit 1 – Why Websites Matter
│   ├── 02-structure     # Learning Unit 2 – File Structure & VS Code
│   └── ...              # Future units (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.)
│
├── examples/            # Code snippets and templates used in class
│
├── notes/               # Based on examples/ - expanded notes discussed in class
│
└── README.md            # This file

```

👉 **All official lecture notes will be stored in the `docs/` folder.** Additional content will be added here as the semester progresses.

## 🙋‍♀️ Important Student Responsibilities

Your success depends on consistent engagement and collaboration. Please keep in mind:

- ✅ **Visit this repository regularly.** New notes, updates, and examples will be posted throughout the term.
- ✅ **Work in your group project repositories.** Each group must manage their own GitHub repo containing source code, design assets, and development notes.
- ✅ **Push code to GitHub frequently.** This helps track your progress and acts as a log of your contributions.
- ✅ **Submit final work via the LMS.** All deliverables (presentations, reports, evaluations) must be officially submitted on **Arc/Brightspace** — GitHub is used for code and collaboration only.

## 🧰 Tools and Technologies Used

In this course, we’ll use a combination of modern development tools:

| Tool                    | Purpose                                        |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Visual Studio Code**  | Code editor used for building and testing sites |
| **GitHub**              | Version control and collaboration               |
| **Virtual Machine**     | Configured lab environment for web development  |

> 💡 If you're working from your own laptop or desktop, **you are responsible for installing, updating, and managing these tools** on your system. Make sure your setup aligns with what's demonstrated in class — especially when working with CSS and file structures.
